# RocketSimulation

A physics-based rocket simulator using **RK4 (Runge-Kutta 4th Order) integration** to simulate rocket burns, orbital transfers, and trajectory planning. Built with a focus on accurate motion dynamics and real-time visualization.

Currently under active development — implementing a **TensorFlow agent** to autonomously control rocket maneuvers and optimize fuel-efficient orbital transfers.
